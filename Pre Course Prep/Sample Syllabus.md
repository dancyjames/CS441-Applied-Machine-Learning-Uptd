> CS 441 AML - Applied Machine Learning
Instructor: Prof. Marco Morales Aguirre
Co-Instructor: Dr. Pablo Robles Granda

## Course Description

This course is intended for students who want to apply techniques of machine learning to various signal problems. The topics of this course are:

## Introduction
1. Classification
2. Regression
3. High Dimensional Data
4. Clustering
5. Graphical Models
6. Deep Neural Networks

*The course is intended for students who wish to apply machine learning methods with a focus on tool-oriented and problem-oriented exposition. Application areas include computer vision, natural language, interpreting accelerometer data, and understanding audio data.*

## Prerequisites

A course in probability or statistics, a course in linear algebra, understanding of differentiation and gradients, and some programming experience.

Lecture Videos, Discussion Sessions, and Office Hours

*The required video-lectures are designed to discuss the topic for each week and complement the textbook readings and programming assignments. The instructor and co-instructor will hold discussion sessions about the topic of each week, these sessions will not cover material that is not part already of the lecture videos and assignments.*

## TA Office Hours

The TAs of the course will host office hours via the Zoom teleconferencing software. The currently scheduled office hour times for each staff member will be posted on Coursera. Additional information for logging into the Zoom sessions will be provided on Coursera. Please refer to the reading item about Zoom office hours in Week 1.

## Graded work: Programming Assignments and Quizzes

The weekly graded work consists on programming assignments and quizzes. Instructions, and particular submission details and deadlines are published in Coursera. An assignment will clearly state when students should implement an algorithm by hand and the restrictions on the libraries to use.

### Submission Procedures

All the quizzes and programming assignments should be submitted on Coursera by their corresponding deadline, which will subsequently be checked and graded.

### Exams

This semester of the course does not have any exams, the grading will be based on quizzes and programming assignments.

### Campuswire Discussion Forum

The course has a discussion forum on Campuswire where students can post questions and get answers from the teaching assistants and from other students. The staff will address questions in the discussion forum every day during business hours, except on UIUC holidays. When formulating questions, students should follow the guidelines that will be posted in Campuswire.

Students will receive an email invitation once they are added to the class on Campuswire.

### Grading, Deadlines, and Late Policy

Students are encouraged to complete each homework in the same week they are assigned in the course. 
**Nevertheless, the deadline for each homework is set a couple of weeks after its corresponding week.**

***Programming assignments and quizzes can be submitted as many times as wanted before the deadline without penalty. 
The highest grade achieved in assignments and quizzes is kept regardless of the number of times they are submitted***

The individual deadline for each homework is set in Coursera. Assignmens or quizzes submitted after their deadline will have a 2% penalty per day of delay. Nevertheless, students must submit all the required assignments no later than Wednesday, May 4 2022, the last day of instruction. There will be an extra assignment for students eligible to get an A+ whose deadline will be published along with the grading scale.

Students in this course are enrolled for 3 credits or 4 credits. The difference between sections is the required assignments and quizzes as follows:

The weights of assignments and quizzes will be shown in Coursera. 
**Please note that the assignment in Week 14 has twice as much weight as those from the rest of the course.**

Once the final scores are determined, a grading scale will be determined to assign a letter grade.
