# NumPy

NumPy is a Python library that's widely used for efficient manipulation of numerical arrays. One of the assignments in this course is an interactive NumPy tutorial. Here are other resources.

**pandas**

pandas is a Python library that provides a dataframe object type, useful for efficient operations on large tables of data, where columns potentially have different types. This is contrasted with how NumPy numerical arrays are generally used as matrices for linear algebra operations.

# Machine learning libraries

There are several higher-level libraries for Python that are explicitly intended for machine learning tasks. Many of the assignments in this course will ask you to implement a machine learning algorithm by yourself, rather than using functions from these libraries directly, so that you can understand the principles of the algorithms. However, these libraries are useful in practice for real-world projects.

**scikit-learn** is an older library that implements some traditional machine learning algorithms -

**TensorFlow** is a common machine learning library for creating neural networks, and can be GPU-accelerated -

**PyTorch** is another popular library with an application to neural networks - 
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/


**TensorBoard** is a tool that can help you visualize and optimize the quality of your machine learning projects:
