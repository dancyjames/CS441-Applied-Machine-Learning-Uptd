Zoom Office Hours Policies
Zoom is a video meet client for teleconferencing. There are desktop clients you can install for video chat, or you can install the mobile app, or you can call in with your phone.

Zoom client downloads are available at the following link. If you intend to connect with the Zoom desktop client or Zoom mobile app, download and install the correct version from this link.

Zoom office hours will be listed as upcoming Live Events in the left-hand menu on Coursera. Click on the Live Event and click "Join via Zoom" to launch the Zoom app and connect. You can also call in by phone without an app. Phone numbers will be listed on the Live Events.

In order to prevent on-campus students from accessing the Zoom office hours meant for online students, please do not release the Zoom live event link information publicly on Piazza. If you need help connecting, you can make a private post.

What to do if the TA is not in the session:

If you connect and can't see the TA there, there may have been an error with the Zoom link, or perhaps the TA had an emergency and needs to reschedule the office hour. In any case, please post a private note on Piazza to notify the staff. They may be able to message you a corrected Zoom link quickly.
