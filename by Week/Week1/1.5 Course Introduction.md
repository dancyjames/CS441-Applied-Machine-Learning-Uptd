**1. Classification**
- prediction of a new data point to a group
- also, study performance metrics

**2. Regression**
- predict numeric value for unseen data

**3. High Dimensional Classification**
- data with many features
- bring to low dimension
- identify most relevant feature

**4. Clustering**
- same as classification without knowing the groups they belong to

**5. Graphical Models**
- probability models for the processes

**6. Deep Neural Network**
- also use classification
- will use powerful connected structure of simple computational units to solve problem

# Some Applications of ML

- collection of lab test. whehter patient have a disease of not.

- OCR - Optimal Character recogniztion - handwritten numbers

- most common topics in text. used in internet to index document.
