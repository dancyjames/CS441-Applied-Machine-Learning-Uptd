Morning. I plan to work on an assignment with primary objective "Assignment Summary
Linear regression with various regularizers The UCI Machine Learning dataset repository hosts a dataset giving features of music, and the location (latitude and longitude) at which that music originate. There are actually two versions of this dataset. Either one is OK, but I think you'll find the one with more independent variables more interesting. In this assignment you will investigate methods to predict music location from the provided features. You should regard latitude and longitude as entirely independent.
First, build a straightforward linear regression of location (latitude and longitude) against features. What is the R-squared? Plot a graph evaluating each regression.
Does a Box-Cox transformation improve the regressions? Notice that the dependent variable has some negative values, which Box-Cox doesn't like. You can deal with this by remembering that these are angles, so you get to choose the origin. For the rest of the exercise, use the transformation if it does improve things, otherwise, use the raw data.
Use glmnet to produce:
A regression regularized by L2 (a ridge regression). You should estimate the regularization coefficient that produces the minimum error. Is the regularized regression better than the unregularized regression?
A regression regularized by L1 (a lasso regression). You should estimate the regularization coefficient that produces the minimum error. How many variables are used by this regression? Is the regularized regression better than the unregularized regression?
A regression regularized by elastic net (equivalently, a regression regularized by a convex combination of L1 and L2 weighted by a parameter alpha). Try three values of alpha. You should estimate the regularization coefficient lambda that produces the minimum error. How many variables are used by this regression? Is the regularized regression better than the unregularized regression?
Logistic regression The UCI Machine Learning dataset repository hosts a dataset giving whether a Taiwanese credit card user defaults against a variety of features here. In this part of the assignment you will use logistic regression to predict whether the user defaults. You should ignore outliers, but you should try the various regularization schemes discussed above."__DATASOURCE__= attached and samples look like this "7.161286,7.835325,2.911583,0.984049,-1.499546,-2.094097,0.576,-1.205671,1.849122,-0.425598,-0.105672,1.728885,1.788986,0.849798,-1.109353,0.537904,-0.115368,5.069512,6.00771,0.820869,0.89619,0.131699,0.859286,2.059065,0.266773,1.192932,-1.421091,2.128661,-1.288109,1.458738,-0.734508,-0.092678,-0.571314,-0.142634,2.748619,3.099077,0.31727,-0.13058,2.048282,-0.173489,0.324616,-0.300817,0.471089,-0.538577,-0.979124,-0.679165,0.135963,-1.094049,-0.072197,-0.752002,-0.660715,1.319729,1.094839,-0.937659,-0.895371,-0.734962,0.441859,0.389178,-0.944584,-0.04361,-1.504263,0.351267,-1.018726,-0.174878,-1.089543,-0.66884,-0.914772,-0.83625,-15.75,-47.95
