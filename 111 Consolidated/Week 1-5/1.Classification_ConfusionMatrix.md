- Example: simply teaching kids to identify alphabets

# Evaluation
> **Accuracy** : index of goodness
> **Error rate** : Index of badness

# Confusion
1 => positive
0 => Negatuve

| Metrics    | Definition |
| -------- | ------- |
| True Positive  | 1 Classified  as 1 |
| True negative | 0 Classified  as 0 |
| False positive | 0 Classified  as 1 |
| False negative | 1 Classified  as 0 |

> **Note**: In below chart,Accuracy and Error chart is for entire table
